# JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

- My motivation when completing this project was to put into practice and become more proficient in the concepts I learned throughout Module 3: Javascript of Bootcamp.
- I built this project to practice applying what I have learned in class about JavaScript and Git to create interactivity on an existing web application by adding to existing JavaScript code.
- Before adding my code, the web page included a "Generate Password" button that, when clicked, diplayed the message "undefined". By adding variables, conditional statements, for loops, and functions, I was able to make the web page interactive.
